I build rigorous, reproducible, and scalable solutions under the 'Cruel Standard': systems must fail loudly and safely rather than hallucinate or mislead.

        cruelBio: "KERNEL PANIC IF HALLUCINATION DETECTED. I refuse to write 'AI for Good' fluff. I write C++20 because Python is too slow for 100M+ edges, and I write R because biologists refuse to learn anything else. My code asserts aggressively. If your data is garbage, my software will crash and tell you exactly why, rather than giving you a pretty p-value. Currently burning GPU cycles training LLMs to say 'I don't know' instead of lying.",
